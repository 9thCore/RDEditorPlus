# RDEditorPlus
BepInEx 5 Rhythm Doctor mod that aims to expand the level editor with Quality of Life features.

Features:  
- Adds experimental multiple row support to the patient, decoration, room and window tabs (disabled by default, as there's high chance of incompatibility with other mods)

Installation:  
- [Install BepInEx](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html) (Any 5.4.* should work just fine, even latest)
- Run the game
- Check existence of `Rhythm Doctor/BepInEx`
- Obtain a copy of the compiled dll (whether this is through building the mod yourself on the `Release` configuration, or through [Releases](https://github.com/9thCore/RDEditorPlus/releases))
- Drop plugin into game files: `Rhythm Doctor/BepInEx/plugins/RDEditorPlus/the_mod_file.dll`
- Run the game
- Check existence of `Rhythm Doctor/BepInEx/config/RDEditorPlus.cfg`
- If it exists, the mod has been correctly installed! This is the config through which you can choose what features to use
